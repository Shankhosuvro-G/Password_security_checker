# Password_security_checker
The Password Strength Checker is a Python-based tool designed to evaluate the security level of passwords. It utilizes regular expressions to assess various characteristics of a password, such as length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Additionally, it estimates the time it would take to crack the password using brute-force methods, providing a practical perspective on password security.
